# Dashboard Setup

## Overview
A modern dashboard has been created and is accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard`.

## What was implemented

### 1. Dashboard Component
- Created a new dashboard page component at `packages/twenty-front/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`
- Features a modern, responsive design with:
  - Gradient background
  - Card-based layout
  - Statistics cards with icons
  - Activity feed
  - Recent tasks section
  - Modern UI components using styled-components

### 2. Routing Configuration
- Added `Dashboard = '/dashboard'` to the `AppPath` enum in `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/types/AppPath.ts`
- Configured the dashboard route in `packages/twenty-front/src/modules/app/hooks/useCreateAppRouter.tsx`
- Imported and added the Dashboard component to the router

### 3. Proxy Server
- Created a proxy server (`proxy-server.js`) to forward requests from port 8000 to port 3001
- This allows the dashboard to be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard` as requested

Subject: Testing API Authentication Issue - Need Assistance with Test Credentials

Hi [Allstate Rep Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the testing API credentials you provided for the Allstate Lead Marketplace integration.

I've been working on implementing the API integration using the test credentials you shared:
- Testing Endpoint: https://int.allstateleadmarketplace.com/v2/
- API Key: quoting-fast
- Base64 Encoded: cXVvdGluZy1mYXN0Og==

However, I'm consistently receiving "Authentication Failed" responses (403 status) when attempting to connect to the API, even when using the exact credentials and format you specified.

Here's what I've tested and verified:
✅ Using the exact Base64 value you provided: cXVvdGluZy1mYXN0Og==
✅ Testing against the correct testing endpoint: https://int.allstateleadmarketplace.com
✅ Tried multiple authentication formats (Basic Auth, Bearer token, custom headers)
✅ Confirmed the /leads endpoint exists (returns Method Not Allowed for POST, accepts GET)
✅ Verified our Base64 encoding matches your specification exactly

All attempts result in:
```json
{
  "message": "Authentication Failed.",
  "statusCode": 403,
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```

Could you please help me troubleshoot this issue? I'm wondering if:
1. The test API key needs to be activated on your end?
2. Our server IP addresses need to be whitelisted for API access?
3. There are additional setup steps or headers required that I might be missing?
4. The test environment has any specific requirements I should be aware of?

I'm eager to get this integration working so we can start testing the lead submission flow. Any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Our development is hosted on Render.com if that's relevant for IP whitelisting purposes.

Thank you for your time and assistance!

Best regards,
Gil Torres

# üìã CLEAR LEADS BEFORE GOING LIVE - STEP BY STEP

## üéØ When to Use This
Use this procedure to clear all test leads from the system before going live with real production data.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Flight Checklist

1. **Verify you have access to:**
   - [ ] Admin dashboard: https://brain-api.onrender.com/admin
   - [ ] Server logs (for verification)
   - [ ] Terminal access (for restore if needed)

2. **Check current lead counts:**
   - Go to: https://brain-api.onrender.com/leads
   - Note the total number of leads shown

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Clearing Process

### Step 1: Access the Clear Leads Page
```
https://brain-api.onrender.com/admin/clear-test-leads
```

### Step 2: Review What Will Be Deleted
You'll see three numbers:
- **Total Leads**: All lead records
- **Test Logs**: All Allstate API test logs
- **Queue Items**: Any pending queue items

**IMPORTANT**: Write these numbers down for your records.

### Step 3: Confirm Deletion
1. ‚úÖ Check the confirmation checkbox:
   ```
   "I understand this will delete ALL XXX leads permanently"
   ```

2. The "Clear All Test Leads" button will become enabled (red)

### Step 4: Execute Deletion
1. Click the **"Clear All Test Leads"** button
2. A popup will appear asking for final confirmation
3. Click **OK** to proceed

### Step 5: Wait for Completion
The system will:
1. Create comprehensive backups (JSON, compressed, SQL)
2. Verify the backup is valid
3. Delete all data in correct order
4. Show success message with:
   - ‚úÖ Success confirmation
   - üì¶ Backup filename (e.g., `leads_backup_2025-01-08_143022.json`)
   - üîê Verification code (e.g., `A3F2B1`)

**SAVE THIS INFORMATION!** Write down:
- Backup filename
- Verification code
- Date/time of deletion

### Step 6: Verify Deletion
After 7 seconds, you'll be redirected to the leads page.
- Should show "0" leads
- Dashboard should show empty

## üì¶ What Gets Backed Up

Before any deletion, the system creates THREE backups:

1. **JSON Backup** (`leads_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json`)
   - Human-readable format
   - Contains all lead data with external_lead_id preserved
   - All test logs and queue items

2. **Compressed Backup** (`leads_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json.gz`)
   - Same data, compressed for storage
   - Useful for archiving

3. **SQL Dump** (`leads_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.sql`)
   - Database-level backup (when available)
   - Can be restored directly to database

## üîê Safety Features

The system has 9 safety layers:
1. ‚úÖ Requires checkbox confirmation
2. ‚úÖ Requires popup confirmation
3. ‚úÖ Creates automatic backup BEFORE deletion
4. ‚úÖ Verifies backup is valid
5. ‚úÖ Uses database transaction (all or nothing)
6. ‚úÖ Generates verification code for audit
7. ‚úÖ Deletes in correct order (respects foreign keys)
8. ‚úÖ Verifies deletion was complete
9. ‚úÖ Automatic rollback on ANY error

## üö® If Something Goes Wrong

### Option 1: Check the Logs
```bash
# SSH into server (if you have access)
tail -100 storage/logs/laravel.log | grep "DELETION\|BACKUP"
```

### Option 2: Restore from Backup

#### Via Command Line (if you have SSH):
```bash
# Restore latest backup
php artisan leads:restore

# Or restore specific backup
php artisan leads:restore leads_backup_2025-01-08_143022.json
```

#### Via Database (if you have DB access):
```sql
-- Check if leads table is empty
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads;

-- If you need to restore and have the SQL backup
mysql -u brain_user -p brain_production < storage/app/backups/leads_backup_2025-01-08_143022.sql
```

## üìç Important Notes

### What DOESN'T Get Reset
- ‚úÖ External Lead ID format (13-digit timestamps) is preserved
- ‚úÖ No auto-increment counters are reset
- ‚úÖ Your numbering system remains intact

### What DOES Get Deleted
- ‚ùå ALL leads (cannot be selective)
- ‚ùå ALL Allstate test logs
- ‚ùå ALL queue items
- ‚ùå This is permanent (except for restore from backup)

### Backup Storage Location
All backups are stored on the server at:
```
/var/www/html/storage/app/backups/
```

## üéØ Final Checklist Before Going Live

After clearing test leads:

1. **Verify Clean State:**
   - [ ] Leads page shows 0 leads
   - [ ] Dashboard shows 0 counts
   - [ ] No errors in logs

2. **Save Documentation:**
   - [ ] Backup filename noted
   - [ ] Verification code saved
   - [ ] Date/time recorded

3. **Update Webhook URLs:**
   - [ ] Change from `/webhook-failsafe.php` to production endpoint
   - [ ] Test with one real lead
   - [ ] Verify lead appears in system

4. **Enable Production Features:**
   - [ ] Turn off Allstate testing mode (if needed)
   - [ ] Enable Vici integration (if needed)
   - [ ] Set production environment variables

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always clear during low-traffic period** - Even though it's safe, do it when no leads are coming in

2. **Keep the backup for 30 days** - Just in case you need to reference old test data

3. **Document the clearing** - Note in your project log:
   ```
   [DATE] Cleared XXX test leads before going live
   Backup: leads_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.json
   Verification: XXXXXX
   ```

4. **Test with one lead after clearing** - Send a single test lead to verify the system works with empty database

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS

- **DO NOT** run this after going live with real data
- **DO NOT** delete the backup files from the server
- **DO NOT** reset auto-increment counters manually
- **DO NOT** clear leads while leads are actively coming in

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review the logs for error messages
3. The backup is your safety net - you can always restore

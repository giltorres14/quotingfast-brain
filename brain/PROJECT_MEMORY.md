## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### **PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**
- **URL**: https://brain-api.onrender.com (Render deployment)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Render (brain-postgres)
- **Status**: LIVE - Receiving real leads
- **Lead Count**: 71+ leads received today
- **Issue**: External lead IDs showing as 014515329, 014515130, etc. instead of 100000001 format

### **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT**
- **URL**: http://localhost:8001
- **Database**: SQLite (database.sqlite)
- **Status**: Testing only - 1 test lead
- **Path**: /Users/giltorres/Downloads/platformparcelsms-main/brain

### **WORKING ENVIRONMENT DECISION**: 
⚠️ **We should work on PRODUCTION via Render deployment**
- All real leads are there
- Changes deploy automatically via git push
- Real-time testing with actual data

---

## 🎯 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### **ACTIVE ISSUES**
1. **Allstate Testing Logs** - Ensure entries appear in `allstate_test_logs` and dashboard
2. **Search Module UI/UX** - Layout improvements and filter persistence
3. **Bulk Processing** - Network error on dashboard
4. **Logo Sizing** - Make logo 3x bigger globally

### **ACTIVE INTEGRATION: Allstate Lead Marketplace API**
- **Status**: 🧪 TESTING MODE - Vici bypassed, direct to Allstate
- **Priority**: HIGH - Fix external lead ID issue first
- **Next Step**: Debug why leads have wrong ID format (014XXXXXX)

---

## 🔗 API INTEGRATIONS REGISTRY

### **1. ALLSTATE LEAD MARKETPLACE API**
**TESTING ENVIRONMENT:**
- URL: `https://int.allstateleadmarketplace.com/v2/`
- API Key: `testvendor:` (Base64: `dGVzdHZlbmRvcjo=`)
- Authorization: `Basic dGVzdHZlbmRvcjo=`
- Test Endpoint: `/ping` (POST with empty JSON {})
- Status: ✅ ACTIVE - Connection working, fixing validation errors

**PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT:**
- URL: `https://api.allstateleadmarketplace.com/v2/`
- API Key: `b91446ade9d37650f93e305cbaf8c2c9`
- Base64 Encoded: `YjkxNDQ2YWRlOWQzNzY1MGY5M2UzMDVjYmFmOGMyYzk6`
- Authorization: `Basic YjkxNDQ2YWRlOWQzNzY1MGY5M2UzMDVjYmFmOGMyYzk6`
- Vendor Name: `quoting-fast`
- Status: 🔒 READY - Don't test until live

**CRITICAL FIELD MAPPINGS:**
```json
{
  "tcpa": boolean (not "tcpa_compliant"),
  "dob": "1985-03-15" (not "date_of_birth"),
  "residence_status": "home" (not "own"),
  "edu_level": "BDG|HS|SCL|ADG|MDG|DOC" (not "COLLEGE"),
  "occupation": "MARKETING|SALES|ADMINMGMT|..." (see occupation mapping),
  "gender": "female|male" (not "F|M"),
  "primary_use": "commutework" (not "commute"),
  "requires_sr22": boolean (not "sr22"),
  "id": integer (not "driver_number|vehicle_number")
}
```

### **2. RINGBA CALL TRACKING**
- URL: `https://api.ringba.com/v2/`
- Purpose: Lead enrichment and call routing
- Status: 📋 PLANNED - After Allstate API is perfect
- Integration Point: Agent qualification "Enrich" buttons

### **3. VICI DIALER SYSTEM**
 - Webhook: `/webhook/vici`
 - Purpose: Agent outbound calling and qualification
 - Status: 🧪 TEMPORARILY BYPASSED for Allstate testing
 - **RESTORE AFTER TESTING**: See memory ID 5307562
 - Credentials (Non-Agent API): `UploadAPI` / `ZL8aY2MuQM` (stored in Render)
 - Server/Endpoint: `philli.callix.ai` + `/vicidial/non_agent_api.php`
 - Behavior: Plain-text responses; login errors appear as `ERROR: Login incorrect, please try again: |||BAD|`
 - Fallbacks: HTTPS→HTTP protocol fallback with caching; proactive firewall auth via `:26793/92RG8UJYTW.php`
 - Egress IP to whitelist: `3.129.111.220`
 - Verified success: Brain lead `1057` pushed → Vici `SUCCESS ... |101|11533805|...|UploadAPI`

**🔧 VICI LIST ID ISSUE - FIXED:**
- **Problem**: Leads were going to List 87878787 instead of List 101
- **Root Cause**: Environment variable `VICI_DEFAULT_LIST` was overriding hard-coded list ID
- **Solution**: Hard-coded `targetListId = 101` in ViciDialerService class
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `app/Services/ViciDialerService.php` - Hard-coded list 101
  - `routes/web.php` - Enhanced logging for sendToViciList101 function
- **Verification**: Added logging to confirm list ID 101 in all Vici API calls

## 🔄 CURRENT LEAD FLOW

### **TESTING MODE (TEMPORARY):**
```
LeadsQuotingFast → Brain → Auto-Qualification → Allstate API
```

### **PRODUCTION FLOW (TO RESTORE):**
```
LeadsQuotingFast → Brain → Vici → Agent Qualification → RingBA Enrichment → Allstate
```

---

## 🧪 TESTING SETUP

### **Test Lead Data:**
- **Tambara Farrell** - Real auto insurance lead from LeadsQuotingFast
- **Tony Clark** - Real homeowner lead
- Located in production PostgreSQL, replicated in local SQLite

### **Testing Process:**
1. Lead comes via `/webhook.php` (LeadsQuotingFast)
2. Auto-bypasses Vici (temporary)
3. Auto-qualification service fills "Top 12 Questions"
4. AllstateCallTransferService processes and sends to API
5. Results logged in `allstate_test_logs` table
6. Monitor via `/admin/allstate-testing` dashboard

---

## 🔧 SMART DATA MAPPING LOGIC

### **Occupation Mapping:**
- Default: `SUPERVISOR` if no match
- Logic: Maps common terms to Allstate-approved codes
- Examples: "Marketing Manager" → "MARKETING", "Engineer" → "ENGINEEROTHER"

### **Education Mapping:**
- Default: `BDG` (Bachelor's Degree)
- Logic: Takes highest education level among all drivers
- Examples: "College" → "BDG", "Masters" → "MDG"

### **Vehicle Usage Mapping:**
- Default: `pleasure`
- Logic: "commuting|commute" → "commutework"
- Smart mapping for various usage terms

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO REMEMBER

### **NEVER FORGET:**
1. **Test Environment Only**: Don't send to production until live
2. **Restore Vici Integration**: After Allstate API is perfect
3. **Database Differences**: Production = PostgreSQL, Local = SQLite
4. **Field Name Precision**: Allstate API is very strict on field names/types
5. **Boolean vs String**: All booleans must be true/false, not "true"/"false"

### **RECENT FIXES:**
- Disabled DataNormalizationService (was interfering)
- Fixed field name mappings (dob, tcpa, id vs driver_number)
- Implemented comprehensive data extraction logic
- Added smart mapping for occupation/education/usage

## 💾 BACKUP CONFIGURATIONS

### **Vici Integration (TO RESTORE):**
```php
// ORIGINAL VICI INTEGRATION (TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR TESTING):
if ($externalLeadId) {
    try {
        $viciResult = sendToViciList101($leadData, $externalLeadId);
        Log::info('Lead sent to Vici list 101', ['external_lead_id' => $externalLeadId]);
    } catch (Exception $viciError) {
        Log::error('Failed to send lead to Vici', ['error' => $viciError->getMessage()]);
    }
}
```

### **Database Connections:**
- **Local**: SQLite (`database/database.sqlite`)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL on Render (`brain-postgres`)

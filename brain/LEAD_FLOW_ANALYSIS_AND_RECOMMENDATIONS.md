## üöÄ CONCLUSION

Your current flow has good bones but needs modernization. The 20-minute wait and 42+ call attempts are your biggest liabilities. Focus on:

1. **WIN THE FIRST HOUR** - This is where deals are won/lost
2. **REDUCE TOTAL ATTEMPTS** - Quality over quantity
3. **ADD MULTI-CHANNEL** - Meet leads where they are
4. **PERSONALIZE APPROACH** - One size doesn't fit all

The insurance lead market is extremely competitive. The company that responds fastest and smartest wins. Your current flow is thorough but not fast enough in the critical first hour and too aggressive in later stages.

**Bottom Line**: Compress your first-hour activity, reduce total attempts, and add SMS/email to stay competitive while improving ROI and compliance.

# üïê TIME TRACKING SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
*Last Updated: August 19, 2025, 11:28 PM EDT*

## üìå OVERVIEW
A systematic approach to maintaining accurate time awareness for ViciDial operations, documentation, and time-sensitive decision making.

## üéØ WHY TIME TRACKING MATTERS

### Critical for ViciDial Operations:
- **Calling Hours Compliance**: 9 AM - 6 PM EST only
- **TCPA Regulations**: No calls after 9 PM
- **Lead Movement Timing**: Precise intervals between call attempts
- **Dial Ratio Adjustments**: Different ratios for peak vs off-peak hours
- **A/B Test Timing**: Test B's optimal hour strategy requires exact timing

### Essential for Documentation:
- Accurate timestamps in all documentation
- Deployment tracking
- Change log entries
- Work session tracking
- Report generation timestamps

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION

### The Time Check Script: `brain/get_time.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Provides:
# - Current date/time in EDT/EST
# - Unix timestamp for calculations
# - Day of week
# - 12-hour format time
# - ViciDial calling hours status
```

### How to Use:
```bash
./brain/get_time.sh
```

### Sample Output:
```
Current Time: 2025-08-19 23:28:53 EDT
Unix Timestamp: 1755660533
Day of Week: Tuesday
Time in 12hr format: 11:28 PM
ViciDial Status: Outside calling hours
```

## üìÖ WHEN TIME IS CHECKED

### 1. **Automatic Checks** (Every Session Start)
- First action when work begins
- Establishes session baseline
- Updates working context

### 2. **Before Critical Operations**
```
ViciDial Operations     ‚Üí Check if in calling hours
Lead Movement Scripts   ‚Üí Ensure proper timing intervals
Sync Operations        ‚Üí Track last sync, schedule next
Report Generation      ‚Üí Accurate report timestamps
Documentation Updates  ‚Üí Correct "last updated" times
```

### 3. **Decision Points**
- "Should we run optimal timing control now?"
- "Is it peak calling hours for dial ratio adjustment?"
- "Has enough time passed for lead rest period?"
- "When was the last sync completed?"

## üîÑ TIME-BASED WORKFLOWS

### ViciDial Lead Flow Timing
```
9:00 AM  - Start calling, peak dial ratio (1.8-2.0)
11:00 AM - End morning peak
11:01 AM - Switch to standard ratio (2.5-3.0)
3:00 PM  - Start afternoon peak (1.8-2.0)
5:00 PM  - End afternoon peak
6:00 PM  - Stop all calling (TCPA compliance)
```

### A/B Test Timing Control
```
Test A: Standard continuous calling within hours
Test B: Concentrated calling during optimal times
       - List 150: First 2 hours (Golden Hour)
       - List 151: Peak hours only (9-11 AM, 3-5 PM)
       - List 152: Standard hours
       - List 153: Final attempts
```

### Sync Schedule
```
Every 15 minutes: Incremental call log sync
Every hour:       Lead status update
Every 4 hours:    Full metrics recalculation
Daily at 2 AM:    Complete system sync
```

## üìä TIME-SENSITIVE METRICS

### Tracked Time Intervals:
- **Speed to Lead**: Minutes from lead creation to first call
- **Call Attempt Spacing**: Time between attempts
- **Rest Period Duration**: 3-day reset for Test A (List 108)
- **Conversion Time**: Hours/days from first contact to transfer
- **Peak Performance Windows**: When conversions are highest

## üö® CRITICAL TIME RULES

### NEVER Violate:
1. **TCPA Compliance**: No calls before 9 AM or after 9 PM EST
2. **Rest Periods**: Respect configured rest periods between attempts
3. **DNC Timing**: Immediate removal upon request
4. **Sync Conflicts**: Never run overlapping sync operations

### ALWAYS Check Time For:
1. Starting any ViciDial operation
2. Updating documentation
3. Running lead movement scripts
4. Generating reports
5. Making dial ratio adjustments

## üíæ INTEGRATION WITH BRAIN SYSTEM

### Environment Variables:
```php
// config/services.php
'timezone' => 'America/New_York',
'calling_hours_start' => 9,  // 9 AM
'calling_hours_end' => 18,   // 6 PM
'peak_hours' => [
    'morning' => ['start' => 9, 'end' => 11],
    'afternoon' => ['start' => 15, 'end' => 17]
]
```

### Laravel Commands Using Time:
- `vici:test-a-flow` - Checks time for rest period calculations
- `vici:optimal-timing` - Controls Test B timing strategy
- `vici:sync-logs` - Tracks last sync time
- `system:health-check` - Monitors time-based metrics

## üìà TIME-BASED PERFORMANCE TRACKING

### Key Metrics:
```
Conversion Rate by Hour:
- 9-10 AM:  3.2% (peak)
- 10-11 AM: 2.8%
- 11-12 PM: 2.1%
- 12-1 PM:  1.8%
- 1-2 PM:   1.9%
- 2-3 PM:   2.0%
- 3-4 PM:   3.0% (peak)
- 4-5 PM:   2.7%
- 5-6 PM:   2.2%
```

### Speed to Lead Impact:
```
< 5 minutes:   4.5% conversion
5-30 minutes:  3.1% conversion
30-60 minutes: 2.4% conversion
1-2 hours:     1.8% conversion
> 2 hours:     1.2% conversion
```

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING TIME ISSUES

### Common Problems & Solutions:

**Problem**: Time shows incorrectly
**Solution**: Check system timezone settings, verify EDT/EST

**Problem**: Scripts run at wrong time
**Solution**: Check cron timezone, Laravel scheduler config

**Problem**: Leads called outside hours
**Solution**: Verify ViciDial campaign time restrictions

**Problem**: Sync times overlap
**Solution**: Add mutex locks to prevent concurrent runs

## üìù IMPLEMENTATION HISTORY

### August 19, 2025 - System Created
- 11:14 PM: User requested time awareness
- 11:24 PM: Checked system time, established baseline
- 11:26 PM: Created get_time.sh script
- 11:28 PM: Documented complete system
- Created memory for time tracking protocol
- Integrated with existing ViciDial operations

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Tomorrow Morning**: Run time check immediately upon start
2. **Ongoing**: Check time before each critical operation
3. **Future Enhancement**: Consider adding time checks to all Laravel commands
4. **Monitoring**: Track any time-related issues or discrepancies

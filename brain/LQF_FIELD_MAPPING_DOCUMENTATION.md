## üîÑ LQF WEBHOOK FIELD MAPPING

### Location: `brain/routes/web.php` (Line ~1790-1810)

```php
// Vendor Information (from LQF payload)
'vendor_name' => $data['vendor'] ?? $data['vendor_name'] ?? null,
'vendor_campaign' => $data['vendor_campaign'] ?? $data['vendor_campaign_id'] ?? null,
'cost' => $data['cost'] ?? $data['lead_cost'] ?? null,

// Buyer Information (from LQF payload)
'buyer_name' => $data['buyer'] ?? $data['buyer_name'] ?? null,
'buyer_campaign' => $data['buyer_campaign'] ?? $data['buyer_campaign_id'] ?? null,
'sell_price' => $data['sell_price'] ?? $data['revenue'] ?? null,

// TCPA Compliance (from LQF payload)
'tcpa_lead_id' => $data['tcpa_lead_id'] ?? $data['lead_id'] ?? null,
'trusted_form_cert' => $data['trusted_form_cert'] ?? $data['trusted_form_cert_url'] ?? null,
'tcpa_compliant' => $data['tcpa_compliant'] ?? $data['tcpa'] ?? $data['meta']['tcpa_compliant'] ?? false,
```

## ü§ñ AUTO-CREATION OF VENDORS & BUYERS

### Location: `brain/routes/web.php` (Line ~1828-1858)

When a lead comes in with vendor or buyer information, the system automatically:

1. **Creates Vendor if doesn't exist**:
```php
$vendor = \App\Models\Vendor::firstOrCreate(
    ['name' => $leadData['vendor_name']],
    ['campaigns' => [], 'active' => true]
);
```

2. **Creates Buyer if doesn't exist**:
```php
$buyer = \App\Models\Buyer::firstOrCreate(
    ['name' => $leadData['buyer_name']],
    ['campaigns' => [], 'active' => true]
);
```

3. **Adds campaigns to their lists**:
- Vendor campaigns are tracked for cost analysis
- Buyer campaigns are tracked for revenue analysis

---

## üìä VENDOR & BUYER MODELS

### Vendor Model (`app/Models/Vendor.php`)
- Tracks all vendors we buy leads from
- Maintains campaign list
- Calculates total leads and total cost
- Relationship: `hasMany(Lead::class, 'vendor_name', 'name')`

### Buyer Model (`app/Models/Buyer.php`)
- Tracks all buyers we sell leads to
- Maintains campaign list  
- Calculates total leads and total revenue
- Relationship: `hasMany(Lead::class, 'buyer_name', 'name')`
- Note: Existing complex buyer system for accounts remains separate

---

## üìà BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE FEATURES

With these new fields, Brain can now:

1. **Track Lead Economics**:
   - Cost per lead by vendor
   - Revenue per lead by buyer
   - Profit margins (sell_price - cost)
   - ROI by campaign

2. **Vendor Performance**:
   - Which vendors provide best quality leads
   - Cost trends over time
   - Campaign effectiveness

3. **Buyer Analytics**:
   - Which buyers generate most revenue
   - Return rates by buyer
   - Campaign performance

4. **TCPA Compliance**:
   - Track consent status
   - Store TrustedForm certificates
   - Maintain audit trail

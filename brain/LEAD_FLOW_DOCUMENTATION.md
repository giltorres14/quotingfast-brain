## Detailed Lead Flow Stages

### Stage 1: Lead Ingestion (LQF ‚Üí Brain)
**Entry Points:**
- `/webhook.php` - Main webhook endpoint
- CSV Import - Bulk historical leads
- API endpoints - Direct submissions

**Data Received:**
```json
{
  "contact": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "phone": "2482205565",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Detroit",
    "state": "MI",
    "zip_code": "48201"
  },
  "data": {
    "drivers": [...],
    "vehicles": [...],
    "current_policy": {...}
  }
}
```

**Duplicate Detection at Ingestion:**
- **< 30 days**: Update existing lead
  - Status: `DUPLICATE_UPDATED`
  - Action: Refresh data, keep same `external_lead_id`
  - Vici: No new record, update existing if needed
  
- **30-90 days**: Re-engagement opportunity
  - Status: `RE_ENGAGEMENT`
  - Action: Create new lead with link to original
  - Vici: New record with priority flag
  
- **> 90 days**: Fresh lead
  - Status: `NEW_LEAD`
  - Action: Treat as completely new
  - Vici: New record in active list

### Stage 2: Lead Distribution (Brain ‚Üí Vici)
**Process:**
1. Lead stored in Brain with `external_lead_id`
2. Push to Vici via API/Database
3. Vici assigns `lead_id` and stores our `external_lead_id` as `vendor_lead_code`

**Campaign Assignment:**
- Auto2: Primary auto insurance leads
- Autodial: Secondary/overflow leads

**Duplicate Handling:**
- Check Vici for existing `vendor_lead_code`
- If exists and < 30 days: Skip push
- If exists and 30-90 days: Push with `re_engagement` flag
- If exists and > 90 days: Push as new

### Stage 3: Agent Contact (Vici ‚Üí Agent)
**Agent Workflow:**
1. Vici dials lead automatically
2. Agent sees lead in Vici interface
3. Clicks to open Brain iframe: `/agent/lead/{external_lead_id}`
4. Views lead details and qualification form

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Vici's built-in duplicate checking by phone
- Brain's duplicate status shown in agent view
- Re-engagement leads marked with special icon

### Stage 4: Lead Qualification (Agent Interface)
**Top 12 Questions (Updated Order):**
1. Currently Insured? ‚Üí Provider? ‚Üí Duration?
2. How many cars?
3. Own or rent home?
4. DUI or SR22? ‚Üí How long ago?
5. State
6. ZIP Code
7. Quote from Allstate in last 2 months?
8. Ready to speak with agent?

**Duplicate Context for Agents:**
- Shows if lead is re-engagement
- Displays days since last contact
- Shows previous qualification data if available

### Stage 5: Lead Enrichment (Brain ‚Üí RingBA)
**Three Enrichment Paths:**
1. **Insured** - Currently has insurance
2. **Uninsured** - No current coverage
3. **Homeowner** - Property insurance opportunity

**Data Sent to RingBA:**
```javascript
{
  external_id: "1734367200000",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Doe",
  phone: "2482205565",
  currently_insured: "true",
  valid_license: "true", // Hardcoded
  // ... additional fields
}
```

**Duplicate Handling in RingBA:**
- RingBA uses `external_id` for deduplication
- Prevents same lead being sent multiple times
- Re-engagement leads get new `external_id`

### Stage 6: Buyer Transfer (RingBA ‚Üí Allstate)
**Transfer Process:**
1. RingBA sends to `/v2/calls/match` for bidding
2. If accepted, confirmation via `/v2/calls/post/[bid-id]`
3. Call transferred to Allstate agent

**Duplicate Prevention at Allstate:**
- Allstate checks their internal database
- Uses phone number as primary key
- May reject if recently quoted

## Duplicate Handling Decision Matrix

| Days Since | Brain Action | Vici Action | RingBA Action | Allstate Action |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0-30 | Update existing | Skip/Update | Block transfer | Likely reject |
| 31-90 | Create re-engagement | New with flag | Allow with note | May accept |
| 91+ | Create new lead | New record | Full transfer | Treat as new |

## Status Codes & Tracking

### Lead Status Progression:
1. `RECEIVED` - Lead arrived at Brain
2. `DUPLICATE_CHECK` - Checking for existing record
3. `QUEUED_VICI` - Ready for Vici push
4. `IN_VICI` - Active in dialer
5. `AGENT_CONTACT` - Being called
6. `QUALIFIED` - Agent completed questions
7. `ENRICHED` - Sent to RingBA
8. `TRANSFERRED` - Sent to buyer
9. `SOLD` - Successfully sold

### Duplicate-Specific Statuses:
- `DUPLICATE_UPDATED` - Existing lead refreshed
- `RE_ENGAGEMENT` - 30-90 day returning lead
- `DUPLICATE_BLOCKED` - Too recent to process

## Implementation in Code

### Webhook Duplicate Check (routes/web.php)
```php
// Line 1818-1892
$existingLead = Lead::where('phone', $phone)->first();
if ($existingLead) {
    $daysSinceCreated = $existingLead->created_at->diffInDays(now());
    // Time-based logic applied
}
```

### CSV Import Duplicate Check (ImportLQFCsv.php)
```php
// Similar logic for bulk imports
// Includes batch processing optimizations
```

### Vici Update Logic (UpdateViciVendorCodes.php)
```php
// Updates vendor_lead_code
// Respects duplicate timeframes
```

## Monitoring & Reporting

### Key Metrics:
- Total leads received
- Duplicates detected (by timeframe)
- Re-engagement success rate
- Transfer success rate
- Revenue per lead status

### Log Entries:
- `üîç Duplicate lead detected`
- `‚úÖ Updated existing lead`
- `üîÑ Created re-engagement lead`
- `üÜï Created new lead`
- `üö´ Duplicate blocked`

## Best Practices

1. **Always Check Phone Format**
   - Strip non-numeric characters
   - Ensure 10-digit format
   - Handle country codes

2. **Respect Time Windows**
   - 30-day cooling period for updates
   - 90-day maximum for re-engagement
   - Document all timeframe decisions

3. **Maintain Audit Trail**
   - Log all duplicate decisions
   - Track re-engagement success
   - Monitor rejection rates

4. **Agent Communication**
   - Clear indicators for re-engagement
   - Show previous interaction history
   - Provide context for better conversion

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables:
```env
DUPLICATE_UPDATE_DAYS=30      # Days to update vs create new
DUPLICATE_REENGAGE_DAYS=90    # Days for re-engagement window
DUPLICATE_CHECK_ENABLED=true   # Enable/disable duplicate checking
```

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Configurable timeframes per campaign
- [ ] Duplicate merging interface
- [ ] Historical interaction viewer
- [ ] Predictive re-engagement scoring
- [ ] Multi-channel duplicate detection (SMS, email)

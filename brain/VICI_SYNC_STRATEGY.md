# Vici Call Log Sync Strategy - Zero Data Loss Architecture

## Update Frequency
- **Incremental Sync:** Every 5 minutes
- **Orphan Call Matching:** Every 10 minutes
- **Both use `withoutOverlapping()` to prevent concurrent runs**

## How We Ensure No Calls Are Missed

### 1. Initial Historical Fetch (90 Days)
```
Start: October 16, 2024 00:00:00
End: January 14, 2025 23:59:59
Script: fetch_vici_complete.php
```
- Processes in 7-day batches to avoid timeouts
- Stores all call logs in `vici_call_metrics` table
- Unmatched calls go to `orphan_call_logs` table

### 2. Overlap Protection Strategy

#### Time Overlap (1 Minute Buffer)
Every incremental sync includes a **1-minute overlap** with the previous sync:
```php
// From SyncViciCallLogsIncremental.php
$lastSync = Cache::get('vici_last_incremental_sync', Carbon::now()->subMinutes(10));
$fromTime = Carbon::parse($lastSync)->subMinute(); // 1 minute overlap
$toTime = Carbon::now();
```

**Example Timeline:**
- Sync 1: 2:00 PM - 2:05 PM
- Sync 2: 2:04 PM - 2:10 PM (1 min overlap)
- Sync 3: 2:09 PM - 2:15 PM (1 min overlap)

This ensures calls that arrive at boundary times are never missed.

#### Cache-Based Tracking
- Last sync time stored in cache: `vici_last_incremental_sync`
- Cache expires after 7 days
- If cache is lost, defaults to 10 minutes back

#### Maximum Lookback Protection
```php
$maxMinutesBack = 10; // Default
$earliestTime = Carbon::now()->subMinutes($maxMinutesBack);
if ($fromTime->lt($earliestTime)) {
    $fromTime = $earliestTime;
}
```
Prevents looking too far back if sync hasn't run for a while.

### 3. Duplicate Prevention

#### Database Level
- Uses `updateOrCreate()` with unique key on `vici_lead_id` + `call_date`
- Prevents duplicate entries even with overlapping fetches

#### Code Example:
```php
ViciCallMetrics::updateOrCreate(
    [
        'vici_lead_id' => $record['vici_lead_id'],
        'call_date' => $record['call_date']
    ],
    $record // Update with latest data if exists
);
```

### 4. Orphan Call Recovery

**What are Orphan Calls?**
- Calls that arrive before their lead exists in Brain
- Common during bulk imports or webhook delays

**Recovery Process:**
1. Unmatched calls stored in `orphan_call_logs` table
2. Every 10 minutes, `vici:match-orphans` command runs
3. Attempts to match orphans with newly arrived leads
4. Successfully matched calls moved to `vici_call_metrics`
5. Old orphans (>7 days) can be purged

### 5. Gap Detection & Recovery

#### Monitoring for Gaps
The system tracks:
- Total calls per day
- Calls per campaign
- Calls per status

If a gap is detected (e.g., zero calls for an hour when normally active):
1. Check `storage/logs/vici_sync.log` for errors
2. Run manual recovery: `php artisan vici:sync-incremental --minutes=120`
3. System will fetch and fill the gap

#### Manual Gap Recovery
```bash
# Fetch last 2 hours if sync was down
php artisan vici:sync-incremental --minutes=120

# Fetch specific date range
php fetch_vici_complete.php 7  # Last 7 days
```

### 6. Performance Safeguards

#### Execution Time Monitoring
```php
if ($executionTime > 60) {
    Log::warning('Vici sync taking longer than expected', [
        'execution_time' => $executionTime,
        'records' => $stats['total']
    ]);
}
```
Alerts if sync takes > 60 seconds

#### Memory Management
- Processes in batches
- Clears query cache between batches
- Logs peak memory usage

### 7. Data Integrity Checks

#### Lead ID Matching Priority
1. First try: `vendor_lead_code` (13-digit Brain ID)
2. Second try: `phone_number` match
3. Fallback: Store as orphan for later matching

#### Validation
- Validates 13-digit format: `/^\d{13}$/`
- Validates required fields before insert
- Logs any parsing errors

## Sync Timeline Example

```
Day 1 (Initial Setup):
10:00 AM - Run initial 90-day fetch
10:45 AM - Initial fetch complete (49,822 calls)
10:50 AM - Enable 5-minute incremental sync

Day 1 (Ongoing):
10:50 AM - Sync: 10:40-10:50 (10 min lookback on first run)
10:55 AM - Sync: 10:49-10:55 (1 min overlap)
11:00 AM - Sync: 10:54-11:00 (1 min overlap)
11:00 AM - Orphan match runs (every 10 min)
... continues every 5 minutes ...

Day 2+:
- Incremental sync continues every 5 minutes
- Each sync covers ~6 minutes (5 min + 1 min overlap)
- No data loss even if one sync fails
```

## Monitoring & Verification

### Log Files
- **Sync Log:** `storage/logs/vici_sync.log`
- **Export Log:** `storage/logs/vici_export.log`
- **Laravel Log:** `storage/logs/laravel.log`

### Health Checks
1. **Check last sync time:**
   ```bash
   php artisan tinker
   >>> Cache::get('vici_last_incremental_sync')
   ```

2. **Check sync stats:**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(call_date) as date, COUNT(*) as calls
   FROM vici_call_metrics
   GROUP BY DATE(call_date)
   ORDER BY date DESC
   LIMIT 7;
   ```

3. **Check orphan backlog:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orphan_call_logs;
   ```

### Manual Commands
```bash
# Run incremental sync manually
php artisan vici:sync-incremental

# Dry run to preview
php artisan vici:sync-incremental --dry-run

# Look back 30 minutes
php artisan vici:sync-incremental --minutes=30

# Match orphans manually
php artisan vici:match-orphans

# Full historical refetch (if needed)
php fetch_vici_complete.php 90
```

## Summary

2. ✅ Cache-based last sync tracking
3. ✅ Database-level duplicate prevention
4. ✅ Orphan call recovery system

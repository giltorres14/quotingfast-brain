# üî¨ A/B TEST CONFIGURATION: Current vs. New Approach

## TEST GROUP A: "CURRENT APPROACH" (Similar to Your 42+ Call Flow)

### DAY 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (5 Calls)
```
0-1 min:   Call #1  - List 101 (Immediate)
20 min:    Call #2  - List 102 (Your current 20-min wait)
1 hour:    Call #3  - List 103 (Follow-up)
3 hours:   Call #4  - List 104 (Afternoon)
6 hours:   Call #5  - List 105 (End of day)
```

### DAYS 2-3: HOT PHASE üî• (12 Calls Total - Your List 104 Approach)
```
Day 2:  6 calls throughout the day (9am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm, 5pm, 7pm)
Day 3:  6 calls throughout the day (similar spread)
```
**Matching your current "Hot Phase" intensity**

### DAYS 4-8: EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP (15 Calls - Your List 106)
```
3 calls per day √ó 5 days = 15 calls
Morning, afternoon, evening rotation
```

### DAYS 9-13: COOL DOWN (10 Calls - Your List 107)
```
2 calls per day √ó 5 days = 10 calls
Varying times to catch different schedules
```

### DAYS 14-20: REST PERIOD ‚è∏Ô∏è (0 Calls - Your List 108)
```
NO CALLS for 7 days - psychological reset
```

### DAYS 21-30: FINAL ATTEMPTS (5 Calls - Your List 109)
```
1 call every other day
Different times each attempt
```

### DAY 30+: REACTIVATION (1 Call - Your List 111)
```
Single "situation changed?" attempt
```

**TOTAL GROUP A: 48 Calls over 30+ days**
- Mirrors your current approach
- Keeps the 20-minute gap you have now
- Maintains your rest period concept
- Similar to your 42+ total

---

## TEST GROUP B: "OPTIMIZED STRATEGIC" (New Approach)

### DAY 1: GOLDEN HOUR FOCUS (5 Calls)
```
0-1 min:   Call #1  - List 201 (Immediate)
5 min:     Call #2  - List 202 (QUICK follow-up, not 20)
15 min:    Call #3  - List 203 (Still in golden hour)
30 min:    Call #4  - List 204 (Half hour mark)
60 min:    Call #5  - List 205 (End of golden hour)
```
**KEY DIFFERENCE: Compressed into first hour, not spread over 6 hours**

### DAY 2: STRATEGIC FOLLOW-UP (2 Calls)
```
9 AM:   Call #6  - Fresh morning attempt
3 PM:   Call #7  - Afternoon follow-up
```

### DAYS 3-7: STEADY PERSISTENCE (5 Calls)
```
1 call per day at varying optimal times
Focus on 10-11 AM and 2-4 PM (best contact times)
```

### WEEK 2 (Days 8-14): SELECTIVE CONTACT (4 Calls)
```
Monday:    Call #13
Wednesday: Call #14  
Friday:    Call #15
Following Monday: Call #16
```

### WEEK 3-4: LONG-TERM NURTURE (2 Calls)
```
Day 21: Call #17 - Check in
Day 28: Call #18 - Final attempt
```

**TOTAL GROUP B: 18 Calls over 28 days**
- Front-loads the critical first hour
- Reduces total attempts by 62%
- No rest period (not needed with fewer calls)
- Strategic timing based on data

# üìä KEY DIFFERENCES TO MEASURE

| Metric | Group A (Current) | Group B (Strategic) | What We're Testing |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Day 1 Calls** | 5 (over 6 hours) | 5 (within 1 hour) | Golden Hour Theory |
| **20-Min Gap** | YES (kept) | NO (5-min instead) | Speed to Lead Impact |
| **Week 1 Total** | 27 calls | 12 calls | Front-load vs Spread |
| **Total Calls** | 48 | 18 | Persistence vs Efficiency |
| **Rest Period** | 7 days (Day 14-20) | None | Rest Period Value |
| **Cost/Lead** | $24 | $9 | ROI Comparison |

# üéØ WHAT THIS TEST WILL TELL YOU

## Critical Questions Answered:

### 1. **The 20-Minute Gap Question**
- Group A: Keeps your current 20-min wait
- Group B: Reduces to 5-min
- **Result will show:** Is that 20-min gap killing conversions?

### 2. **Total Volume Question**
- Group A: 48 calls (your current approach)
- Group B: 18 calls (optimized)
- **Result will show:** Are those extra 30 calls worth it?

### 3. **Golden Hour Question**
- Group A: 5 calls spread over 6 hours
- Group B: 5 calls compressed into 1 hour
- **Result will show:** Does speed really matter that much?

### 4. **Rest Period Question**
- Group A: 7-day break (your List 108)
- Group B: No break, just fewer calls
- **Result will show:** Does the rest period help or hurt?

# üìà SUCCESS METRICS

## Primary Metrics:
1. **Contact Rate** - Who reaches more leads?
2. **Conversion Rate** - Who closes more deals?
3. **Cost Per Acquisition** - Who's more efficient?
4. **Time to Contact** - Who connects faster?

## Secondary Metrics:
1. **DNC Rate** - Who gets more complaints?
2. **Agent Satisfaction** - Which agents prefer?
3. **Lead Quality Score** - Which leads are happier?
4. **Optimal Call Number** - Where do conversions peak?

# üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Week 1: Setup
- Create Lists 101-111 for Group A (your current flow)
- Create Lists 201-209 for Group B (new strategic flow)
- Configure Vici campaigns
- Set up tracking

## Week 2-3: Run Test
- 50/50 split all new leads
- Monitor daily
- No changes mid-test

## Week 4: Analysis
- Statistical significance check
- ROI calculation
- Winner declaration
- Implementation decision

# üí° PREDICTION & HYPOTHESIS

## My Prediction (Based on Data):

**Group B will win on:**
- ROI (much lower cost)
- Agent satisfaction (fewer rejections)
- Lead satisfaction (fewer complaints)

**Group A might win on:**
- Raw contact rate (hard to avoid 48 calls)
- Total conversions (if persistence really pays)

**The Real Question:**
Does Group A's 166% higher cost ($24 vs $9) generate 166% better results?

**My Hypothesis:** 
- Group B will have 80% of Group A's conversions at 37% of the cost
- The 20-minute gap is hurting you more than you know
- Calls 20-48 are probably losing money

But that's why we TEST - data beats opinions!

# ‚úÖ READY TO IMPLEMENT?

This test will definitively answer:
1. Is your current approach optimal?
2. Should you fix the 20-minute gap?
3. Can you cut calls by 60% and maintain results?
4. Is the rest period helping?

**The beauty:** You're testing YOUR ACTUAL PROCESS against an optimized version. Whatever wins, you'll have DATA to back the decision.

Want me to set this up in Vici with these exact configurations?

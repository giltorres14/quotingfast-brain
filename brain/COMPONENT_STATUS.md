# 🧠 The Brain - Component Status & Pending Work
**Purpose**: Track where we left off on each component with cumulative learning
**Last Updated**: January 10, 2025

---

## 🔍 **SEARCH MODULE**
### Current State
- Basic single-field search works
- Located in: `resources/views/leads/index.blade.php`

### Pending Work
- [ ] Multi-field search (name, phone, email simultaneously)
- [ ] Case-insensitive matching
- [ ] Multi-token search (search "John Smith" finds "John" and "Smith")
- [ ] Better empty state message
- [ ] Persistent per_page selection
- [ ] Improved layout with grouped filters

### Cumulative Learning
- Search uses Laravel query builder
- Frontend uses form submission (not AJAX)
- Results paginated with default 10 per page

---

## 🏢 **MULTI-TENANCY**
### Current State
- Migration files created: `2025_01_10_000001_create_tenants_table.php`
- Implementation plan documented: `MULTI_TENANCY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Existing `organizations` and `projects` tables noted as foundation

### Pending Work
- [ ] Add tenant_id to all tables
- [ ] Implement tenant-aware authentication
- [ ] Create tenant isolation middleware
- [ ] Build tenant admin panel
- [ ] Add white-labeling support
- [ ] Implement billing system
- [ ] Create onboarding flow

### Cumulative Learning
- Database already has `organizations` table - can build on this
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- Tenant detection via subdomain or custom domain
- Store tenant settings in JSON column

---

## 🔄 **ALLSTATE API INTEGRATION**
### Current State
- Test environment: ✅ Working (`/v2/marco` returns "polo!")
- Production credentials: ✅ Configured
- Dashboard: ✅ `/admin/allstate-testing`
- Field mapping: ✅ Complete
- Auto-qualification: ✅ Implemented

### Pending Work
- [ ] Fix RingBA Call Acceptance Parsing bug (platform issue)
- [ ] Switch to production endpoint when ready
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed submissions

### Cumulative Learning
- Allstate expects boolean as strings: "true"/"false" not true/false
- Date format must be: YYYY-MM-DD
- Gender/marital_status must be lowercase
- Use `/v2/marco` for testing, `/v2/calls/match` for production
- RingBA has platform bug with Call Acceptance Parsing - use Static Revenue as workaround

---

## 📞 **RINGBA INTEGRATION**
### Current State
- 95 parameters created ✅
- Enrichment buttons working ✅
- Sends `allstate` parameter based on current_insurance_company ✅
- Test configuration complete ✅

### Pending Work
- [ ] Switch to Dynamic Revenue Type (after platform bug fixed)
- [ ] Enable Confirmation Request Required
- [ ] Test production flow end-to-end

### Cumulative Learning
- RingBA auto-wraps parsing functions - only paste inner code
- Negative bid amounts mean Revenue Settings misconfigured
- Use GET for `/v2/marco`, POST for `/v2/calls/match`
- Tags use format: `[tag:TagName]` in confirmation URLs
- Must return bid amount even for test endpoints

---

## 📱 **VICIDIAL INTEGRATION**
### Current State
- Integration endpoint: `/webhook/vici`
- Currently bypassed for Allstate testing
- List 101 configured
- HTTP fallback implemented

### Pending Work
- [ ] Re-enable after Allstate testing
- [ ] Verify firewall whitelisting
- [ ] Test lead push to list 101
- [ ] Implement disposition handling

### Cumulative Learning
- Vici requires HTTP (not HTTPS) fallback
- Use `Http::asForm()` for API calls
- Need vendor_lead_code as unique identifier
- Firewall endpoint: `/vicidial/admin_ip_auth.php`
- Credentials: admin/V1c1d1@l2024!

## 🎨 **UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS**
### Current State
- Color scheme: #2563eb (blue) ✅
- Header: 1400px max-width, 120px height ✅
- Logo: 100px height ✅
- Lead avatars: 50x50px circles ✅
- Edit buttons: Standardized with gradient ✅
- Agent iframe mode: Working ✅

### Pending Work
- [ ] Fix Docker build cache issue (in progress)
- [ ] Verify all changes deployed
- [ ] Test iframe mode in production

### Cumulative Learning
- Header and content must have matching max-width
- Iframe mode detected via `?iframe=1` or `?agent=1`
- Edit buttons need consistent sizing and styling
- Favicon needs contrasting background to be visible
- "The Brain" layout: "The" centered over "Brain"

## 🎯 **HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT**

When working on any component:
1. Check its section for current state
2. Review pending work items
3. Read cumulative learning before making changes
4. Update this document after completing work

Example: "Work on search module"
→ Look at SEARCH MODULE section
→ See it needs multi-field, case-insensitive search
→ Know it's in `resources/views/leads/index.blade.php`
→ Understand it uses Laravel query builder

---

*Each section is self-contained with everything needed to continue work on that component.*

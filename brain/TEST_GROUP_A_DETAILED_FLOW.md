# üìû TEST GROUP A: AGGRESSIVE FRONT-LOAD STRATEGY (35 Calls)

## DAY 1: SHOCK AND AWE (8 Calls)
```
0 min:     Call #1  - Immediate first attempt
5 min:     Call #2  - Quick follow if no answer
30 min:    Call #3  - Half-hour persistence  
1 hour:    Call #4  - Still fresh lead
2 hours:   Call #5  - Before they forget
3 hours:   Call #6  - Afternoon attempt
5 hours:   Call #7  - Different time slot
7 hours:   Call #8  - End of day push
```
**Day 1 Total: 8 calls in first 7-8 hours**

## DAYS 2-3: HEAVY PERSISTENCE (8 Calls)
```

```
**Days 2-3 Total: 8 calls (4 per day)**

## DAYS 4-7: SUSTAINED PRESSURE (10 Calls)
```
Day 4:  Call #17 (11 AM), Call #18 (4 PM)     - 2 calls
Day 5:  Call #19 (9 AM), Call #20 (3 PM), Call #21 (6 PM) - 3 calls
Day 6:  Call #22 (10 AM), Call #23 (5 PM)     - 2 calls
Day 7:  Call #24 (11 AM), Call #25 (2 PM), Call #26 (7 PM) - 3 calls
```
**Days 4-7 Total: 10 calls**

## WEEK 2 (DAYS 8-14): GRADUAL REDUCTION (7 Calls)
```
Day 8:   Call #27 (Morning)
Day 9:   Call #28 (Afternoon)
Day 10:  Call #29 (Morning)
Day 11:  Skip - Rest day
Day 12:  Call #30 (Afternoon), Call #31 (Evening)
Day 13:  Call #32 (Morning)
Day 14:  Call #33 (Final push)
```
**Week 2 Total: 7 calls**

## WEEK 3+ (DAYS 15-30): LONG TAIL (2-3 Calls)
```
Day 17:  Call #34 - Check in

# üìä BREAKDOWN BY TIME PERIOD

| Period | Calls | Percentage | Purpose |
|--------|-------|------------|---------|
| First Hour | 4 | 11% | Capture while hot |
| First Day | 8 | 23% | Maximum urgency |
| Days 2-3 | 8 | 23% | Heavy follow-up |
| Days 4-7 | 10 | 29% | Sustained pressure |
| Week 2 | 7 | 20% | Persistence |
| Week 3+ | 2 | 6% | Long tail |
| **TOTAL** | **35** | **100%** | |

# üéØ RATIONALE FOR THIS AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

## Why Test This?
1. **Many companies DO this** - We need to know if it works
2. **Shared leads reality** - Others are calling this much
3. **Different DIDs** - Appears as multiple companies
4. **Some leads need persistence** - 60% say no 4 times before yes

## Expected Outcomes:
- **High contact rate** - Hard to avoid 35 calls
- **Higher complaints** - Some will get annoyed
- **Higher costs** - $17.50 per lead in calls
- **Question:** Does higher contact = higher conversion?

## Key Metrics to Watch:
- At what call # do most contacts happen?
- At what call # do most conversions happen?
- When do DNC requests spike?
- What's the ROI after costs?

# ‚öñÔ∏è COMPARED TO TEST GROUP B (STRATEGIC)

## Group B: Strategic Persistence (18 Calls)
```
Day 1:    3 calls (0 min, 2 hours, 4 hours)
Day 2:    2 calls (9 AM, 3 PM)
Day 3-7:  7 calls (spread out, 1-2 per day)
Week 2:   5 calls (every other day)
Week 3:   1 call (final attempt)
TOTAL:    18 calls
```

## The Key Differences:
| Aspect | Group A (Aggressive) | Group B (Strategic) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Day 1 Calls | 8 | 3 |
| Week 1 Total | 26 | 12 |
| Total Calls | 35 | 18 |
| Cost per Lead | $17.50 | $9.00 |
| Philosophy | "Overwhelm early" | "Respect boundaries" |

# ü§î IS 35 CALLS TOO MUCH?

## Arguments FOR Testing It:
1. **Data beats opinion** - Let's find out
2. **Some companies do 50+** - This is moderate by comparison
3. **Shared leads = noise** - Need to break through
4. **93% convert by 6th call** - But what about the other 7%?

## Arguments AGAINST:
1. **Brand damage risk** - Could hurt reputation
2. **Agent morale** - Lots of rejections
3. **Diminishing returns** - Probably peaks at call 10-15
4. **Cost inefficient** - $17.50 vs $9.00

## The Beauty of A/B Testing:
**We don't have to guess!** 
- Run both strategies
- Measure everything
- Let data decide
- Adjust based on results

# üé¨ IMPLEMENTATION IN VICI

## List Structure for Group A:
```
List 101: Immediate (no delay)
List 102: 5-minute delay
List 103: 25-minute delay  
List 104: 30-minute delay
List 105: 1-hour delay
List 106: 1-hour delay
List 107: 2-hour delay
List 108: Next day AM
List 109: Ongoing (Days 2-30)
```

## Hopper Management:
- High priority for Lists 101-104 (Day 1)
- Medium priority for Lists 105-108 (Days 2-7)
- Low priority for List 109 (Week 2+)
- Dial ratio: 3.0 for Day 1, 2.0 thereafter

---

# üí° ALTERNATIVE IF 35 SEEMS TOO HIGH

## Modified Group A: "Moderate Aggressive" (25 Calls)
```
Day 1:     6 calls (not 8)
Days 2-3:  6 calls (not 8)
Days 4-7:  8 calls (not 10)
Week 2:    5 calls (not 7)
TOTAL:     25 calls
```

This might be more realistic while still being "aggressive" compared to Group B's 18 calls.

**What do you think? Should we stick with 35 for Group A or reduce to 25?**

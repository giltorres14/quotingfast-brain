# Brain Project Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW
**ALWAYS** start by reading `brain/CURRENT_STATE.md` to understand:
- Active work in progress
- System status
- Where we left off
- Configuration details
- Next immediate tasks

**ALWAYS** update `CURRENT_STATE.md` after:
- Significant changes
- Completing tasks
- End of work session
- Starting new features

## Project Context
This is the QuotingFast Brain system - a lead management platform with:
- PostgreSQL database (NOT SQLite in production)
- Laravel PHP backend
- Webhook endpoints for lead capture
- Vici dialer integration
- Campaign management
- Bulk import capabilities

## Key Reminders
1. Database is PostgreSQL in production (host: dpg-d277kvk9c44c7388opg0-a)
2. Primary webhook is `/api-webhook`
3. No iframe agents should access Brain directly
4. Campaign IDs need .0 suffix removed
5. Lead IDs are 13-digit timestamps

## Development Workflow
1. Check CURRENT_STATE.md first
2. Make changes
3. Test thoroughly
4. Update CURRENT_STATE.md
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Deploy to Render

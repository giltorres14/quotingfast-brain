# Daily Development Log - January 14, 2025

## Overview
Major work on lead import optimization, UI improvements, and campaign management features.

## 1. Lead Import Optimization & Bulk Processing

### Problem
- Initial imports were extremely slow (estimated 5+ days for completion)
- Suraj CSV: ~13,800 leads 
- LQF CSV: ~70,000 leads
- Need to complete imports within hours, not days

### Solutions Implemented

#### A. Optimized Import Commands
- **Suraj Import (`suraj:bulk-import-v2`)**: 
  - Added batch processing (1000 records at a time)
  - Implemented in-memory duplicate checking using phone number index
  - Used `insertOrIgnore` for faster duplicate handling
  - Added progress bars and detailed statistics
  - Result: ~8-13 minutes for full import

- **LQF Import (`lqf:bulk-import`)**: 
  - Similar optimizations as Suraj
  - Added logic to REPLACE Suraj bulk leads if duplicate phone found
  - Preserves original `external_lead_id` when replacing
  - Stores old Suraj data in meta field for history
  - Ensures complete payload storage for all fields

#### B. Parallel Processing
- Ran both imports simultaneously using background processes (`&`)
- Commands used:
```bash
# Suraj import (background)
php artisan suraj:bulk-import-v2 ~/Downloads/Suraj\ Leads --pattern="*.csv" --batch-size=1000 --skip-duplicates &

# LQF import (background)  
php artisan lqf:bulk-import ~/Downloads/LQF_Leads_08-06-2025.csv --batch-size=1000 --skip-duplicates &
```

### Import Results
- Successfully imported thousands of leads in minutes instead of days
- LQF leads properly replace Suraj duplicates while preserving IDs
- All payload data preserved for future use

## 2. Vici Call Log Integration

### Features Added
- **Orphan Call Log System**: Stores call logs that can't be matched to leads
  - Created `OrphanCallLog` model and migration
  - Modified `SyncViciCallLogs` command to store unmatched calls
  - Created `MatchOrphanCalls` command for later matching

- **Vici Call Logs Dashboard** (`/admin/vici-call-logs`):
  - Shows calls today, connected calls, average talk time
  - Connection rate statistics
  - Campaign performance metrics
  - Recent calls with lead information
  - Manual sync trigger button

- **Database Tables**:
  - `vici_call_metrics`: Stores call metrics
  - `orphan_call_logs`: Stores unmatched call logs for later processing

## 3. UI/UX Improvements

### Lead View Page (`agent/lead-display.blade.php`)

#### Visual Enhancements
- **QuotingFast Logo**: Increased to 3x size (180px height)
- **Removed Duplicate Elements**: 
  - Removed duplicate QuotingFast logo
  - Removed "LEADSQUOTINGFAST" source bubble from header
  - Cleaned up redundant visual elements

#### Security & Access Control
- **Removed "Back to Leads" button** from edit view to prevent iframe agents from accessing Brain
- **Save button repositioning**: Moved closer to lead information for better UX

#### Data Display Improvements
- **Buy/Sell Price Display**: 
  - Shows both sell price (green) and buy price (red)
  - Pulls buy price from meta or payload if not in main field
  - Format: "Sell: $X.XX" and "Buy: $X.XX"

- **Jangle Lead ID Fix**:
  - Correctly extracts from `payload['id']` field
  - Falls back to `jangle_lead_id` field
  - Properly displays in Lead IDs section

- **JSON Handling**: 
  - Added `is_string()` checks before `json_decode()`
  - Prevents double-decoding errors
  - Handles both string and array formats from controller

## 4. Campaign Management Improvements

### Campaign ID .0 Suffix Fix
- **Problem**: Campaign IDs showing as "1013453.0" instead of "1013453"
- **Solutions**:
  1. **Display Fix**: Updated Campaign Directory to remove .0 on display
  2. **Import Fix**: Modified Suraj import to clean IDs during import
  3. **Database Cleanup**: Created script to clean existing campaign IDs
  
- **Cleaned Fields**:
  - `campaign_id`
  - `buyer_id` 
  - `vendor_id`
  - `vendor_campaign_id`

- **Results**: 
  - Cleaned 9 existing campaigns in database
  - Future imports won't have .0 suffix
  - Display properly formatted on Campaign Directory

### Campaign Directory Features (In Progress)
- Added Delete button to Actions column (alongside Edit)
- Styled with red gradient background
- Delete confirmation to prevent accidents
- (JavaScript function still needs to be completed)

## 5. Database & Infrastructure

### PostgreSQL Configuration
- **Production Database**: `brain-postgres` (PostgreSQL 16, Ohio)
  - Host: `dpg-d277kvk9c44c7388opg0-a.ohio-postgres.render.com`
  - Database: `brain_production`
  - Successfully connected and operational

### Webhook Endpoints
- **Primary**: `/api-webhook` - Main endpoint for LeadsQuotingFast
  - Captures all lead fields including:
    - `jangle_lead_id`
    - `leadid_code`
    - `trusted_form_cert`
    - `tcpa_consent_text`
    - `landing_page_url`
    - `opt_in_date`
  
## 6. Bug Fixes

### JSON Decode Errors
- **Issue**: Double-decoding of JSON fields causing errors on lead view
- **Fix**: Added type checking before decode operations
- **Affected Files**: `agent/lead-display.blade.php`, `routes/web.php`

### Vici Call Metrics Lookup
- **Issue**: Using wrong ID when querying ViciCallMetrics
- **Fix**: Changed from `$leadId` to `$lead->id` in routes/web.php

## 7. Code Quality & Maintenance

### Git Commits Made Today
1. "Fix Campaign ID .0 suffix issue in directory and imports"
2. Multiple UI improvement commits
3. Vici integration enhancements
4. Import optimization updates

### Files Modified
- `app/Console/Commands/ImportSurajBulkCsvFastV2.php`
- `app/Console/Commands/ImportLqfBulkCsv.php`
- `resources/views/agent/lead-display.blade.php`
- `resources/views/campaigns/directory.blade.php`

- `app/Console/Commands/SyncViciCallLogs.php`
- `app/Models/OrphanCallLog.php` (created)
- `resources/views/admin/vici-call-logs.blade.php` (created)

## 8. Performance Metrics

### Import Speed Improvements
- **Before**: 5+ days estimated
- **After**: 8-13 minutes total
- **Improvement**: ~500x faster

### Database Operations
- Batch inserts of 1000 records
- In-memory duplicate checking
- Optimized indexing on phone field

## 9. Pending Tasks

### To Complete
1. Finish Campaign Delete functionality (JavaScript function)
2. Set up automated Vici sync schedule
3. Continue monitoring import progress

### Next Steps
- Test all webhook endpoints with live data
- Verify Allstate integration readiness
- Performance monitoring of bulk imported leads

## 10. Important Notes

### Data Integrity
- All original CSV data preserved in `payload` field
- Duplicate handling preserves original lead IDs
- LQF data replaces Suraj data on phone match
- Historical data stored in meta field

### System Status
- Vici integration currently PAUSED during bulk imports
- Webhook endpoints active and receiving leads
- Campaign auto-detection working
- All UI improvements deployed to production

## Summary
Today's work focused on solving the critical import speed issue, improving the UI/UX for agents, fixing data display bugs, and enhancing campaign management. The system is now capable of processing large CSV files in minutes rather than days, while maintaining data integrity and providing better visibility into lead and campaign information.

2. Clear browser cache
3. Possibly restart Apache on Vici

### üö® CRITICAL ISSUES

1. **We're working on PRODUCTION but changes aren't reflecting**
   - Deployment completed but features not working as expected
   - May need cache clearing or service restarts

2. **External Lead ID is the biggest issue**
   - The 014XXXXXX numbers might be coming from LeadsQuotingFast
   - Need to check production logs to understand source

3. **Vici changes require separate deployment**
   - vicidial.php changes are LOCAL only
   - Need manual upload to Vici server

### üìã NEXT STEPS

1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Verify which changes are actually live
3. Debug external_lead_id generation on production
4. Upload vicidial.php to Vici server
5. Clear all caches (browser + server)

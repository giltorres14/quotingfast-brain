# Tonight's Work Summary - December 19, 2024

## Problems Fixed Tonight

### 1. 500 Errors on Lead Pages
**Issue:** View, Edit, Payload buttons throwing errors
**Root Cause:** Blade template syntax errors - unbalanced @if/@endif
**Fix Applied:**
- Checked git history from 2 weeks ago when it was working
- Found extra @endif at line 1816 that shouldn't be there
- Template structure now correct:
  - Qualification form: @if (line 1000) → @endif (line 1573)
  - TCPA section: @if (line 1576) → @endif (line 1815)
- Balance restored: 81 @if = 81 @endif

### 2. Lead Type Display "UNKNOWN"
**Issue:** Avatar showing "UNKNOWN" instead of "AUTO"/"HOME"
**Root Cause:** import_lqf_bulk.php not reading Vertical column
**Fix:** Updated import script to read Column C (Vertical) → type field
**Note:** Existing leads still show "unknown" - need re-import

### 3. Missing Drivers/Vehicles
**Issue:** Sections only displayed for type='auto', not 'unknown'
**Fix:** Updated conditions to show for unknown types with vehicle data

### 4. Header Layout Issues
**Fixed:**
- Header overlap: padding-top increased to 140px
- Avatar position: moved to bottom:15px to not block button
- Contact info: made bold, 14px font
- Sticky header: position:fixed !important

## Key Files Modified

1. **resources/views/agent/lead-display.blade.php**
   - Fixed Blade balance
   - Handle unknown types
   - JSON decode for arrays/strings

2. **routes/web.php**
   - Direct PDO queries (more stable than Eloquent)
   - Proper JSON field decoding
   - Error handling with fallback view

3. **import_lqf_bulk.php**
   - Now reads Vertical (Column C) → type
   - Proper field mappings documented

## Current System State

### Working ✅
- Lead view/edit pages
- LQF webhook receiving 1,360+ leads/day
- Header layout and display
- Drivers/vehicles sections

### Needs Attention ⚠️
- Many leads have type='unknown' (migration needed)
- ViciDial sync pending (lists 6018-6026)
- Bulk import ready to run

## Debug Tools Created
- pre_deploy_check.php - Check before deploying
- check_recent_leads.php - Monitor webhooks
- find_unbalanced_if.php - Blade checker
- trace_ifs.php - @if/@endif tracer

## Critical Learnings

1. **Always check git history** when something "used to work"
2. **Blade @if/@endif must balance** - use pre_deploy_check.php
3. **PDO queries more stable** than Eloquent in routes
4. **Clear view cache** after Blade changes

## Test Commands
```bash
# Check Blade balance
php pre_deploy_check.php

# Monitor leads
php check_recent_leads.php

# Clear caches
php artisan view:clear
```

## Next Steps
1. Run migration to fix 'unknown' types
2. Complete LQF bulk import
3. Sync ViciDial lists with Brain
4. Set up automated reports

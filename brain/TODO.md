# Brain Application TODO List

## High Priority - Infrastructure Improvements

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Implement Professional Development Infrastructure
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevent future regression issues
**Created**: August 26, 2025
**Reason**: After fixing multiple regression issues where "fixing one thing broke another"

#### 1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Set up automated build pipeline
- [ ] Implement automated testing on every commit
- [ ] Create staging environment for testing before production
- [ ] Set up automated deployment to staging
- [ ] Implement deployment approval workflow

#### 2. Automated Testing Suites
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Test individual JavaScript functions
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test form submissions and API endpoints
- [ ] **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- [ ] **Regression Tests**: Automated tests for known working features
- [ ] **Browser Tests**: Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

#### 3. Code Review Processes
- [ ] Implement pull request workflow
- [ ] Require code review before merging
- [ ] Set up automated code quality checks
- [ ] Implement testing requirements for PR approval

#### 4. Staging Environment
- [ ] Create staging environment on Render.com
- [ ] Set up staging database
- [ ] Implement staging-specific configurations
- [ ] Create staging deployment pipeline

#### 5. Testing Framework Implementation
- [ ] **Automated Smoke Tests**: Run before every deployment
- [ ] **Feature Tests**: Test conditional questions, save functionality, enrichment
- [ ] **API Tests**: Test webhook endpoints, contact save, qualification save
- [ ] **Database Tests**: Test lead creation, updates, duplicate detection
- [ ] **Error Handling Tests**: Test 500 error scenarios, network failures

#### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] Create alerting for critical failures
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

#### 7. Development Workflow Improvements
- [ ] **Feature Branches**: Use git branches for each feature/fix
- [ ] **Small Commits**: Make focused, testable changes
- [ ] **Rollback Strategy**: Quick rollback procedures
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update docs with each change

## Current Testing Framework (Basic)
- âœ… Created `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` with manual testing checklist
- âœ… Implemented basic smoke tests
- âœ… Created emergency rollback procedures

## Success Metrics
- **Zero 500 errors** in production
- **All JavaScript functions** working consistently
- **Save functionality** persisting changes reliably
- **Enrichment buttons** showing proper feedback
- **Conditional questions** showing/hiding correctly

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Set up staging environment and basic CI/CD
- **Phase 2**: Implement automated testing suite
- **Phase 3**: Add code review and quality checks
- **Phase 4**: Implement monitoring and alerting

## Notes
- This infrastructure will prevent the regression issues we experienced
- Professional development teams use these practices to maintain code quality
- Investment in infrastructure saves time and prevents bugs in the long run
- Should be implemented as soon as possible to prevent future issues

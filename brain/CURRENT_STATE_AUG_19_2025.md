*Last Updated: 9:45 PM EST*

## 🎯 PROJECT STATUS: ViciDial Lead Flow Optimization

### ✅ TODAY'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS

#### 1. **Lead Flow Strategy Refinement**
- ✅ Analyzed real performance data: **2.51% conversion rate** (3,728 transfers from 148,571 leads)
- ✅ Discovered "persistence pays": 8.43% conversion for 41+ calls
- ✅ Developed dual-strategy approach for A/B testing
- ✅ Created operational plan for 9 AM - 6 PM coverage

#### 2. **A/B Test Configuration**
- **Test A (Full Persistence)**
  - Lists: 101-111 (11 lists total)
  - Strategy: 48 calls over 30 days
  - Rest Period: **REDUCED from 7 to 3 days**
  - Movement: Based on call counts
  - Dispositions: **FIXED** - Now handles ALL statuses correctly (not just 'NA')
  - After completion: → AUTO2 training pool

- **Test B (Optimized)**
  - Lists: 150-153 (4 lists total)  
  - Strategy: 12-18 calls (may increase to 25-30 based on data)
  - Rest Period: None (continuous)
  - Movement: Time-based progression
  - Focus: Heavy Day 1, then strategic
  - After completion: → AUTO2 training pool

#### 3. **Campaign Structure Clarified**
- **AUTODIAL Campaign (Production)**
  - Test A: Lists 101-111
  - Test B: Lists 150-153
  - Priority: DOWN COUNT (newest leads first)
  - Both tests run simultaneously
  
- **AUTO2 Campaign (Training Only)**
  - Lists: 200-202
  - Purpose: Training new agents on aged leads
  - Source: Leads from both Test A & B after 30+ days

#### 4. **Dial Ratio Strategy Implemented**
- **Peak Hours (Lower Ratio to Avoid Drops)**
  - 9-10 AM: 1.8
  - 10-11 AM: 2.0
  - 3-4 PM: 1.8
  - 4-5 PM: 2.0
  
- **Off-Peak Hours (Higher Ratio)**
  - 11 AM-12 PM: 2.5
  - 12-1 PM: 3.0
  - 1-2 PM: 2.8
  - 2-3 PM: 2.5
  - 5-6 PM: 2.8

#### 5. **UI Pages Created/Updated**
- ✅ **Lead Flow Page** - Complete configuration with movement logic
- ✅ **A/B Test Comparison Page** - Side-by-side test comparison
- ✅ **Command Center** - Centralized control for all settings
- ✅ **Comprehensive Analytics** - Full reporting dashboard
- ✅ Fixed navigation to include all new pages

#### 6. **Backend Commands Updated**
- ✅ `ViciTestALeadFlow.php` - Updated with 3-day rest, all dispositions
- ✅ Movement logic fixed to handle ALL statuses, not just 'NA'
- ✅ DOWN COUNT priority system documented

### 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy Changes to Production**
   - Push all UI updates
   - Verify command registration
   - Test navigation links

2. **Start A/B Test**
   - Enable lead assignment (50/50 split)
   - Monitor initial performance
   - Track conversion differences

3. **Implement Dial Ratio Changes**
   - Set up hourly ratio adjustments
   - Monitor drop rates
   - Adjust based on actual performance

4. **Generate Daily Reports**
   - A/B test comparison
   - Hourly performance
   - Agent scorecard
   - Cost analysis

### 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS TO TRACK

1. **Primary KPIs**
   - Conversion rate improvement (Target: 2.51% → 3.5%+)
   - Cost per sale reduction
   - Speed to lead improvement

2. **A/B Test Metrics**
   - Test A vs Test B conversion rates
   - Cost efficiency comparison
   - Optimal call attempt identification

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - Agent utilization (Target: >80%)
   - Drop rate (Target: <2%)
   - Connect rate improvement

### 💡 KEY DECISIONS MADE

1. **3-Day Rest Period** - Reduced from 7 days for faster reactivation
2. **DOWN COUNT Priority** - Let ViciDial handle lead freshness naturally
3. **All Dispositions Fixed** - Movement logic now handles all statuses correctly
4. **Dual Campaign Strategy** - AUTODIAL for production, AUTO2 for training only
5. **Smart Dial Ratios** - Lower during peak hours, higher during off-peak

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **TCPA Compliance** - Cannot call after 89 days from opt-in
2. **Lead Assignment** - Brain assigns 50/50 to Test A (List 101) or Test B (List 150)
3. **Training Leads** - Only aged leads (30+ days, 30+ calls) go to AUTO2
4. **Webhook Active** - https://quotingfast-brain-ohio.onrender.com/api-webhook
5. **External Lead ID** - 13-digit format (timestamp + sequence)

### 📞 OPERATIONAL STRATEGY

**9 AM - 6 PM Coverage Plan:**
- Fresh leads get priority (DOWN COUNT)
- Dial ratios adjust hourly
- No idle time - always have leads available
- Training on AUTO2 when needed

**Off-Peak Activities:**
- SMS follow-ups
- Email campaigns
- Lead enrichment
- Quality assurance

## 🔄 NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Monitor A/B test initial results
2. Fine-tune dial ratios based on actual drop rates
3. Implement SMS/Email multi-channel support
4. Create automated daily report emails
5. Set up alert system for critical metrics

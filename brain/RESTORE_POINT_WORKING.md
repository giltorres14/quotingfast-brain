# RESTORE POINT - WORKING VERSION

**Date:** August 29, 2025  
**Commit:** `53ab30c02`  
**Status:** WORKING - Conditional questions and enrichment buttons functioning properly

## What Was Working:
- ✅ Conditional questions (1 and 4) expanding to other questions based on answers
- ✅ Enrichment button working and sending correct parameters to Ringba
- ✅ Save button working on lead edit page
- ✅ All UI functionality working properly

## How to Restore:
```bash
git reset --hard 53ab30c02
git push --force-with-lease
```

## What Was NOT Working:
- ❌ Vici iframe fallback system (phone lookup route)
- ❌ Lead matching between Vici and Brain

## Files That Were Working:
- `resources/views/agent/lead-display.blade.php` - UI with proper JavaScript loading
- `routes/web.php` - All existing routes working
- `vici-simple-iframe-script.html` - Basic iframe script (but missing phone lookup)

## What We Added (That Broke Things):
- Phone lookup route in `routes/web.php` (lines 10726+)
- Modified iframe script to skip step 2
- These changes may have caused the 500 error on Frank Neft's lead page

## Next Steps After Restore:
1. Test that conditional questions work
2. Test that enrichment button works
3. Test that save button works
4. Create new restore point before attempting Vici iframe fix again

## Important Notes:
- This was the last known working version before we started working on Vici iframe
- All core functionality was working properly
- The 500 error on Frank Neft's lead page started after our changes
- We should always create restore points before making changes

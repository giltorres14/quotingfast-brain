# Lead Flow Conversation Summary & Current State
*Last Updated: January 18, 2025*

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATE - WHERE WE LEFT OFF**

### **Lead Flow Implementation Status**
✅ **COMPLETED:**
- All SQL queries for lead movement (101→102→103→...→110)
- Laravel command `vici:execute-lead-flow` with all movements
- Cron job running every 5 minutes
- TCPA compliance (89-day limit)
- Special lists: 112 (NI retarget), 120 (training), 199 (TCPA expired)

🔄 **IN PROGRESS:**
- Importing 90 days of Vici call logs (currently running)
- Waiting to stop Make.com integration

⏳ **PENDING:**
- Generate comprehensive reports from 90-day data
- Final decision on A/B test parameters based on actual data

## 📊 **THE LEAD FLOW EVOLUTION**

### **1. Initial Understanding**
You explained that leads are **shared** (sold to multiple companies), which completely changed our strategy:
- "These leads are sold to a lot of people, I'm sure. So a ton of people are calling like this in the beginning."
- "We are calling from several DIDs, they will never know it is us that called so many times"

### **2. Key Insights You Provided**
- **Current capacity:** "So right now we only have 8-10 people calling. We will eventually go up to 20-25. We call on a ratio of 2 calls per agent."
- **Your concern:** "I want to avoid complaints"
- **Your wisdom:** "Why not do a lot of dialing throughout and then use data to see what the results are"

### **3. Strategy Evolution**

#### **Initial Recommendation: "Smart Delay"**
- Wait 30-60 minutes before first call
- Let competitors burn out the lead
- *You correctly rejected this*

#### **Your Counter: "Controlled Aggression"**
- Call immediately and frequently
- Use multiple DIDs to mask identity
- Let data drive decisions

#### **Final Agreement: A/B Testing**
Your idea: "Should I have 2 different lead flows with different lists in the flow that the brain sends leads to 1 by 1"

## 🔬 **A/B TEST CONFIGURATION**

### **Test A: Current Aggressive (48 calls total)**
**Day 1:** 5 calls (every 20 min for first 2 hours)
**Days 2-3:** 4 calls/day
**Days 4-14:** 3 calls/day  
**Days 15-30:** 2 calls/week
**Days 31-89:** 1 call/week

### **Test B: Strategic Reduced (18 calls total)**
**Day 1:** 3 calls (immediate, +30min, +2hr)
**Days 2-3:** 2 calls/day
**Days 4-7:** 1 call/day
**Days 8-30:** 2 calls/week
**Days 31-89:** 1 call/month

## 📋 **FINALIZED LEAD FLOW (Lists 101-120)**

### **Main Flow**
1. **List 101** - Brand new leads (immediate call)
2. **List 102** - After 1st call (20-min delay)
3. **List 103** - After 3 NA (leave VM)
4. **List 104** - Day 2-3 (4x/day)
5. **List 105** - Day 4-6 (2nd VM)
6. **List 106** - Day 7-10 (3x/day)
7. **List 107** - Day 11-17 (2x/day)
8. **List 108** - Day 18-30 (3x/week)
9. **List 110** - Day 31-89 (1x/week)

### **Special Lists**
- **List 112** - NI Retargeting (rate reduction script)
- **List 120** - Training list for Auto2 campaign
- **List 199** - TCPA Graveyard (expired leads)

### **Reset Times for Lists**
- 9:00 AM
- 11:30 AM
- 2:00 PM
- 4:30 PM

## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS MADE**

### **1. Late-Day Lead Handling**
**Your Question:** "What happens if we get a lead at 5 PM?"
**Answer:** "Speed + Consistency"
- Always call immediately regardless of time
- Continue pattern next day
- Never let a lead sit untouched

### **2. Call Counting Logic**
**Only ACTUAL DIALS count** (from `vicidial_dial_log`), not:
- Manual status changes
- System events
- Non-dial statuses

### **3. NI Retargeting Strategy**
**Your Idea:** "Retarget NI statuses, maybe a new voice or different attitude on call back"
**Implementation:** 
- Wait 7 days after NI status
- Move to List 112
- Use "rate reduction in your area" script
- Agent alert pops up in iframe

### **4. Training Campaign (Auto2)**
**Your Requirement:** "Setting up Auto2 dial campaign to be for training agents"
- Use aged but valid leads (60-89 days old)
- Assigned to List 120
- Keeps new agents practicing on real but less valuable leads

## 📈 **WHAT WE'RE TESTING**

### **Key Questions** (from A/B test page)
1. Does aggressive Day 1 calling (5 calls) improve contact rates?
2. Is there a point of diminishing returns?
3. How do shared leads respond to different patterns?
4. What's the optimal cost per conversion?
5. Do voicemail callbacks justify the effort?
6. Can we reduce calls without losing sales?

### **Metrics to Track**
- Contact rate by attempt number
- Conversion rate by list
- Cost per lead (at $0.004/min)
- Callback rates from VM
- Complaint rates
- Time to first contact

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate** (Today)
1. ✅ Lead flow SQL queries - DONE
2. 🔄 Import 90 days of call logs - IN PROGRESS
3. ⏳ Stop Make.com once Brain→Vici confirmed
4. ⏳ Generate reports from historical data

### **This Week**
1. Analyze 90-day metrics
2. Adjust lead flow based on data
3. Start A/B test with 50/50 split
4. Monitor complaint rates

### **Ongoing**
1. Weekly performance reviews
2. Adjust call patterns based on results
3. Optimize for ROI not just contact rate

## 🎯 **CURRENT FOCUS**

**Right now we're:**
1. Importing 90 days of Vici call logs (running in background)
2. Ready to execute lead flow via SQL
3. Waiting for you to stop Make.com
4. Ready to generate comprehensive reports once import completes

**The system is READY** - just need to:
1. Confirm Brain→Vici push is working
2. Stop Make.com
3. Let the automated flow take over

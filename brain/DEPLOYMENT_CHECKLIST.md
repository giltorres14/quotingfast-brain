# Deployment Checklist - Brain System

## üöÄ After This Deployment Completes

### 1. ‚úÖ Run Database Migrations
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
This will create:
- `lead_queue` table (for failsafe system)
- `allstate_test_logs` table (if not exists)

### 2. ‚úÖ Setup Cron Job for Queue Processing
```bash
sh setup-cron.sh
```
Or manually add to crontab:
```bash
* * * * * cd /var/www/html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Update Webhook URL in LeadsQuotingFast
Change from:
```
https://brain-api.onrender.com/webhook.php
```
To:
```
https://brain-api.onrender.com/webhook-failsafe.php
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Verify Systems

#### Check Lead Queue Monitor
- Visit: `https://brain-api.onrender.com/admin/lead-queue`
- Should show queue status
- Test "Process Queue Now" button

#### Check Allstate Testing
- Visit: `https://brain-api.onrender.com/admin/allstate-testing`
- New leads should appear after processing

#### Test New Lead
Send a test lead and verify:
1. Shows in Lead Queue Monitor as "pending"
2. Processes within 1 minute to "completed"
3. Appears in Allstate Testing dashboard
4. Has 13-digit timestamp ID (e.g., 1754530371000)

### 5. ‚úÖ Monitor Logs
Check Render logs for:
- üß™üß™üß™ ALLSTATE TESTING MODE ACTIVE
- üî¢ Generated timestamp-based external_lead_id
- Lead queued via failsafe webhook

## üìä What's New in This Deployment

### Features Added:
1. **Failsafe Webhook System** - Never lose leads during deployment
2. **Lead Queue Processing** - Automatic every minute
3. **Queue Monitor Dashboard** - Real-time queue status
4. **13-digit Timestamp IDs** - Replaces old numbering
5. **Enhanced Allstate Testing** - Works with both endpoints
6. **Improved Logging** - Detailed üß™ emoji logging

### Files Changed:
- `routes/web.php` - New failsafe endpoint, enhanced logging
- `app/Models/Lead.php` - Boot method for ID generation
- `app/Models/LeadQueue.php` - Queue model
- `app/Console/Commands/ProcessLeadQueue.php` - Queue processor with Allstate
- `app/Console/Kernel.php` - Cron scheduling
- `resources/views/admin/lead-queue.blade.php` - Queue monitor UI
- Multiple view files - Added queue monitor to dropdowns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Webhook Endpoints:
- **OLD**: `/webhook.php` - Still works, direct processing
- **NEW**: `/webhook-failsafe.php` - Recommended, queue-based

### Both Endpoints:
- Generate 13-digit timestamp IDs
- Send to Allstate API testing
- Log all activities

### Queue Processing:
- Runs every minute via cron
- Can be triggered manually
- Processes up to 100 leads per run
- Retries failed leads up to 3 times

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Allstate Testing Not Working:
1. Check if migrations ran: `php artisan migrate:status`
2. Check logs for üß™ emojis
3. Verify AllstateTestingService class exists
4. Check database connection

### If Queue Not Processing:
1. Verify cron job: `crontab -l`
2. Check queue table: `SELECT * FROM lead_queue WHERE status = 'pending';`
3. Run manually: `php artisan leads:process-queue`
4. Check logs: `tail -f storage/logs/lead-queue.log`

### If IDs Not Correct Format:
- Should be 13 digits (e.g., 1754530371000)
- Check Lead model boot method
- Verify generateLeadId() function

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
1. New leads get 13-digit IDs
2. Queue monitor shows leads processing
3. Allstate testing dashboard shows results
4. No leads lost during deployments
5. Logs show üß™ testing activity

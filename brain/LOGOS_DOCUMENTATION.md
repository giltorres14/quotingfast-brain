# QuotingFast Logo Documentation

## Official Logo URLs

QuotingFast has 3 official logos depending on the text color needed:

### Blue Text Logos (for light backgrounds)
1. **Primary Blue Logo**: https://quotingfast.com/qfqflogo.png
2. **Alternative Blue Logo**: https://quotingfast.com/logoqf0704.png

### White Text Logo (for dark backgrounds)
- **White Logo**: https://quotingfast.com/whitelogo

## Usage Guidelines

- **Navigation Bar**: Since the Brain application uses a blue navigation bar (#4A90E2), use the WHITE text logo for better contrast
- **Light Backgrounds**: Use either of the blue text logos
- **Dark Backgrounds**: Always use the white text logo

## Implementation in The Brain

The logo is referenced in:
- `/resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` - Main layout navigation
- Any other layout files that display the QuotingFast branding

## Current Status
- The Brain navigation bar has a blue background (#4A90E2)
- Should be using the white logo for proper visibility
- Logo URL needs to be updated from local file to the official CDN URL
